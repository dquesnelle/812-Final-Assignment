## Background

Nitrogen fixation is the process in which atmospheric nitrogen is converted into ammonia or other nitrogenous compounds in order to increase its reactive potential. Without the ability to fix nitrogen, the biosynthesis of nitrogen-containing macromolecule building blocks such as amino acids and nucleic acids would not be possible. This is because nitrogen in its atmospheric form is extremely stable and thus is largely unable to react with other elements to form compounds. Given the importance of nitrogen-containing compounds in the biosynthesis of plants, animals, and other organisms, the process of nitrogen fixation is essential to life.

Though nitrogen fixation can occur through inorganic means, the majority of nitrogen fixation is made possible by enzymes called nitrogenases. These enzymes are found in certain bacterial species and work by combining free nitrogen with other elements to form ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites, which may then be used in further reactions. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria often associate with plant roots where they are able to provide the plant with metabolically active nitrogen. These nitrogen fixing microorganisms play an important role in nitrogen cycling as they are responsible for over 90% of all nitrogen fixation on earth ("nitrogen fixation").

Nitrogenases are encoded by a variety of nif genes. One such gene is nifH, which codes for one of the three nitrogenase subunits called dinitrogenase reductase. nifH is the choice genetic marker to search for when identifying nitrogen-fixing microorganisms. In our project, we will be looking at the alignment of nifH gene between a variety of bacterial species. Learning more about the conservation of nifH sequences is important when studying how nifH genes differ between bacterial species.

## Methods

NifH gene sequences from 100 different species of bacteria and archaea were collected from the NCBI Gene database. The gene IDs of the 100 gene sequences were compiled into a table along with other identifiers like gene and species name. To isolate the gene IDs from the other components of the table, we ran the file through a script that returns only the gene IDs in numeric form. It's in this form that we can use these gene IDs to retrieve the actual sequences. We took advantage of a command-line tool called Entrez Direct to retrieve our sequences. Entrez Direct is part of a larger tool called Entrez that is used for searching and fetching information from NCBI, and is one of the preferred methods for retrieval of genomic, coding and protein sequences (3). We ran the numeric array of gene IDs through an Entrez script that searched NCBI for each gene sequence, converted them to FASTA format and then outputted them to a file that would end up containing all 100 sequences.
